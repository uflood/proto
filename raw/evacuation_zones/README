This directory contains a client-side web script for creating evacuation
zone GeoJSON files from ESRI JSON provided by the City of Boston.

Open converter.html in a modern HTML5 browser and it will convert
the files included in the 'json' directory into GeoJSON files, which
you can then download.

N.B. This is hardcoded to specific file names, it is not a generic converter.
